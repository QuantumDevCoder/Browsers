# Browsers
A collective library of Dockerfile browsers, put together into a docker image. (Browsers include Microsoft Edge, FireFox, Opera, etc.)

## USAGE:
1. Use the Dockerfiles provided within the existing browser folder, and package/push an Docker Hub Image So that you can keep your own version, (⚠ Note: No Image Pushed will result in your own data in the risk of being deleted from newer image versions overlappping the existing image)

2. Use the Browser configuration files to Access the Root Container.
   ```bash
   (Files that End With [.conf] In the Root Folder Of The Browser)
   ```

3. Deploy The Dockerfile, And Enjoy.
